# Swordfish

A classic Smalltalk IDE for GemStone/Smalltalk developed by Reahl Software Services.

## Overview

Swordfish is a Python-based IDE that provides a classic Smalltalk development experience for GemStone/Smalltalk. It features class/method browsing, method editing, debugging capabilities with stepping functionality, and an object inspector.

This project was developed as an experiment in AI-assisted programming, with significant portions (including this README and other metadata) generated through collaboration between human developers and AI, followed by developer refinement and refactoring.

## Features

- Class and method browsing
- Method editing
- Debugging with step execution
- Object inspection
- Classic Smalltalk IDE experience

## Technical Details

Swordfish is built with:
- Python
- Tcl/Tk for the GUI interface (implemented without prior knowledge of the toolkit)
- Parseltongue - our custom library that enables calling GemStone/Smalltalk methods from Python

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install from PyPI
pip install swordfish
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/reahl/swordfish.git
cd swordfish

# Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# After installation, run directly from command line
swordfish

# Or if installed from source
python -m swordfish
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Tcl/Tk
- Parseltongue (proprietary dependency)
- Access to a GemStone/Smalltalk environment

## AI-Assisted Development

This project serves as an exploration of how AI can be incorporated into software development workflows. Our key insights include:

- The initial framework of the app was developed entirely by prompting the AI.
- As the codebase grew, we started refactoring to extract duplication and address other important code smells.
- We introduced an event-handling mechanism to allow for better design regarding event handling.
- We found that refactoring helps tremendously by allowing us to give the AI smaller relevant chunks of context to work with.

Throughout the process, human developers provided domain expertise, drove architectural decisions, performed code reviews, and handled integration and testing. The project demonstrates how AI can be an effective collaborator in software development when combined with sound software engineering practices.
